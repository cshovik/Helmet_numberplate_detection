# Helmet_numberplate_detection

This project utilizes YOLO v10 to detect if a motorcycle rider is wearing a helmet and to recognize license plate numbers. With the help of powerful YOLO v10 algorithms, this project aims to enhance road safety by detecting violations and recording number plate information in real-time.

## YOLO v10 - Key Algorithms and Architecture
- Cross Stage Partial Networks (CSPNet): CSPNet helps YOLO v10 achieve efficient layer aggregation and enhanced learning capacity. This reduces computational cost while maintaining high accuracy, which is essential for recognizing small details like helmets and license plates.
- Anchor-Free Detection: YOLO v10 reduces reliance on predefined anchor boxes, simplifying the model structure and improving detection precision for small or irregularly shaped objects. This is particularly useful for the helmet and license plate detection tasks, where objects can vary greatly in size and shape.
- Multi-Scale Training: This technique allows the model to generalize better across various resolutions. It trains the model to detect objects at different scales, improving robustness in real-world conditions where objects may appear in diverse sizes, distances, and perspectives.
- Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS): YOLO v10 incorporates optimized NMS to filter overlapping bounding boxes, retaining only the most confident detections. This is crucial in scenarios where multiple objects are close together, such as helmets on multiple riders or overlapping license plates.
- Data Augmentation: YOLO v10 employs advanced data augmentation techniques. These augmentations enable the model to perform better in varied environments, improving real-world accuracy.
     - Mosaic Augmentation: Combines four images into one during training, improving the model's ability to detect small objects.
     - Random Cropping and Rotation: Helps the model learn to detect objects from various angles, increasing robustness.
     - Random Cropping and Rotation: Helps the model learn to detect objects from various angles, increasing robustness.
- Dynamic Model Configurations:YOLO v10 offers various configurations (like yolov10n, yolov10s, yolov10m, etc.) to provide a balance between speed and accuracy, allowing for adaptable performance across different hardware and detection tasks. This flexibility ensures the model is optimized for specific detection scenarios, whether high-speed detection or high-accuracy detection is prioritized.

## Fine Tunning and parameters
1) Learning Rate Schedule:
    - Initial Learning Rate (lr0=0.01): The starting learning rate is set relatively high to accelerate the initial learning phase.
    - Final Learning Rate (lrf=0.0001): The learning rate is gradually decreased to this final value, ensuring stability in the final stages of training and helping the model settle into an optimal minimum.
2) Batch Size (batch=8):
    - A batch size of 8 is used, balancing memory usage and stability during training. Small batch sizes like this are often suitable for more stable convergence on limited hardware.
3) Flip Augmentation:
    - Vertical Flip (flipud=0.5) and Horizontal Flip (fliplr=0.5): These augmentations are applied with a probability of 50%, helping the model generalize better to different object orientations.
4) Color Augmentation:
    - Hue Shift (hsv_h=0.015): Allows hue variation of up to ±1.5%, which helps the model to adapt to different lighting conditions.
    - Saturation Shift (hsv_s=0.7): Allows saturation variation of up to 70%, further enhancing the model’s ability to handle diverse lighting and color conditions.
    - Brightness Shift (hsv_v=0.4): Allows brightness variation of up to 40%, making the model more robust to shadow or illumination changes.
5) Mixup Augmentation (mixup=0.1):
    - Mixup is a data augmentation technique where two images are blended together to create synthetic training data. This helps the model become more robust by learning from blended examples, which is especially helpful for detecting 
      overlapping or partially obscured objects.
7) Auto Augment (auto_augment=randaugment):
    - Random augmentation strategies are applied, further improving the model's ability to generalize. randaugment applies random transformations to images, making the model more adaptable to various environments and conditions.
8) Cosine Learning Rate Scheduler (cos_lr=True):
    - A cosine learning rate scheduler is used to gradually decrease the learning rate in a cosine pattern, which helps prevent the model from getting stuck in suboptimal solutions and improves convergence.
